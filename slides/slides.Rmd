# Motivations

Why should you care about this topic?

--

**Academic systems evaluate people**
* I dislike this, but that doesn't make it less true

--

Success requires self-advocacy

* NOT the same as boasting
* make it **easy for other people to find and learn about your work**

---
# Learning Outcomes

* understand the FAIR principles as they relate to scientific data management
* explain the benefits of ORCID and Google Scholar profiles
* define DOI, its attributes, and uses
* identify tools and platforms for publishing interim research products

---
# Costs

* to my knowledge, all of the tools introduced here are *free*
  - they may have paid tiers with additional features
  - funding sources often include large non-profits, funding agencies, etc.
* **DO be aware that some platforms are run by for-profit publishing companies that are monetizing data on academics**

---

# FAIR

---
# FAIR

* Guidelines for *Scientific Data*
  (but which apply more generally)
  - Findable
  - Accessible
  - Interoperable
  - Reusable

---
# Findable

* Can humans and machines find the data?
  - use metadata that accurately *describes* the content
  - use metadata that helps people *find* the content
  
---
# Metadata

**`[def]`** data that describes or gives information about other data

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The ISO country code for Namibia is NA, which has been a hilariously frustrating discovery I made while coding today <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/rstats?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#rstats</a></p>&mdash; Sarah Bowden (@mamabphd) <a href="https://twitter.com/mamabphd/status/1273352107240968193?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 17, 2020</a></blockquote> 

* hashtag identifies content as related to R
---
# Accessible

* there should be minimal barriers to access the data
  - e.g. no proprietary interfaces or software required
  - "available upon (reasonable) request" is insufficient!
* use established methods to authenticate access to protected or private data

---
# Interoperable

* use a common, shared format for storage
* use a metadata standard for attributes
  - [FAIR Data Point](https://github.com/FAIRDataTeam/FAIRDataPoint/wiki/FAIR-Data-Point-Specification) is one
  - some are domain-specific, e.g. [Ecological Metadata Language](https://eml.ecoinformatics.org/)

---
# Reusable

* add descriptions to help researchers identify whether it is suitable for their usage
* use a legal license that enables re-use
  - e.g. CC-BY or CC-0
  - **don't use a code license**, e.g. MIT
* include attribution and a description of how to cite the data

---
# Summary

* FAIR principles are intended to make data more useful
  - the same principles apply for academic work!
  
* for more on data, see the [Research Data Management Libguide](https://guides.uflib.ufl.edu/datamanagement)

# Personal Profiles

# Your Academic Identity

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Never ceases to amaze me how many postdoc scientists &amp; other early career researchers have basically zero internet presence. Many have no website (beyond an impoverished uni site &amp; even that&#39;s often missing), no readily available contact details, no pub list.<br><br>Don&#39;t be invisible.</p>&mdash; Chris Chambers (@chrisdc77) <a href="https://twitter.com/chrisdc77/status/1090198315617132545?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 29, 2019</a></blockquote>

# is it FAIR?

* Findable
* Accessible
* Interoperable
* Reusable

---
# ORCID

* https://orcid.org/
* Open Researcher and Contributor IDentifier
* unique ID that stays with you, regardless of changes in name, email, institution
* common way to login to journals and identify yourself on publications

---
# Google Scholar

* https://scholar.google.com/
* IMO, does the best job of automatically identifying your *papers*
* allows you to correct errors in the records for your works
* citation statistics
  - these are imperfect, but LOTS of people care and this makes it easy for them to check

---
# LinkedIn

* https://www.linkedin.com/
* a *must* if you are considering a position in industry
* use the right buzzwords for your skills
  - find people with jobs that you aspire to, and see what buzzwords they use

---
# Other

* ask around to see what sites are common in your field
  - not just what people use, but what they use to *look up or find applicants*
* consider a personal website:
  - present more detailed information NOT found in other sites
  - many free and nice options (custom domains are about $10/year)

# DOI

---
# DOI = Digital Object Identifier

* format
  - `10.NNNN/{suffix}`
  - `NNNN` identifies the registrant
  - `{suffix}` identifies the object
  - e.g. `10.5281/zenodo.3892184`
---
# DOI Properties

* DOIs are permanent
  - the object and metadata record are archived
* unambiguous
  - each DOI links to a unique object, and will only ever link to that object
  
---
# Why is this Important?

A given DOI always point to the same object.
- (some exceptions for updating the metadata or deleting the object)

The scholarly record needs permanence.
- someone else needs to be able to look up your sources
- DOIs fit this role

Most journals issue a DOI for each article.

---
# Get DOIs for Your Work

* If you have interim products, e.g.
  + code
  + datasets
  + protocols
  + images/video
--

* **A DOI makes that work citable!**
  + for fellowship/grant/job applications

---
class: inverse, center, middle

# Publishing Platforms

---
# Places that issue DOIs

* preprint servers
* data repositories
* general-purpose repositories
* tooling-specific repositories

---
# Preprints

* papers, before peer-review and journal formatting
* very common in math & physics, catching on elsewhere

--

why?

* share your work more quickly
  - not delayed until peer review
* (sometimes) get feedback

---
# Preprint servers

* [arXiv.org](https://arxiv.org/) -- primary one for math and physics
  - uses their own indexing instead of DOI
* [bioRxiv.org](https://www.biorxiv.org/) -- primary one for biology
* [medRxiv.org](https://www.medrxiv.org/) -- primary one for health sciences
* many others
  - including [OSF-hosted servers](https://osf.io/preprints/)

---
# Data Repositories

* Zenodo
  - https://zenodo.org/
  - approved by UF IT for data storage (workshops forthcoming)
  - 50 GB capacity, supported by CERN
* Dryad - https://datadryad.org
* figshare - https://figshare.com

---
# Data Repositories

Additional Notes
* Use whatever is common for your field / journal
* Be aware of sharing restrictions for protected/private data
* See the [Research Data Management Libguide](https://guides.uflib.ufl.edu/datamanagement) for details

---
# General Purpose Repositories

* Open Science Framework
  - https://osf.io/
  - files can be uploaded or linked through github, dropbox, google drive, etc.
  - projects can be embedded within other projects
  - can issue DOIs for public projects

---
# Tooling-Specific

For specific (common) applications:
* laboratory protocols and handy app -- https://www.protocols.io/
* computer code -- https://github.com
  - does not issue DOI, but deposits to Zenodo
* pre-register study design and analysis -- https://clinicaltrials.gov/, or https://osf.io/
* [list of journals with registered reports](https://www.cos.io/our-services/registered-reports)
