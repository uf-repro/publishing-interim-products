## Description

It can take a long time for research to be published as a peer-reviewed publication, which can be a burden for early career researchers (ECRs) when they apply for fellowships, grants, and jobs. This workshop will survey various tools and platforms that enable researchers to share and publish interim products, such as data, code, protocols, posters, etc.; to solicit feedback, demonstrate accomplishments, and get cited for work that isn't a peer-reviewed publication. (Both NSF and NIH accept interim products in grant applications and reports, provided they are citable.)
