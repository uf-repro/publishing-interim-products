## Description

This workshop will survey various tools and platforms that enable
researchers to share and publish interim products, such as data, code,
protocols, posters, etc.; to solicit feedback, demonstrate
accomplishments, and get cited for work that isn’t a peer-reviewed
publication.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of the workshop, participants will be able to:

-   explain the benefits of ORCID and Google Scholar profiles
-   define DOI, its attributes, and uses
-   understand the FAIR principles for scientific data management
-   identify tools and platforms for publishing interim research
    products
